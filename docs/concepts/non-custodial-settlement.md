# Non-custodial settlement

"Non-custodial" is a precise term, not a marketing word. This page is what
SlipPay actually means by it.

## The claim

At no point does SlipPay hold the merchant's funds. Settlement is
**direct, atomic, on-chain**: buyer's wallet signs a transaction that
moves USDC (or PYUSD) from buyer address to merchant address. SlipPay
observes the transaction, matches it to an order, and notifies the
merchant. SlipPay never has signing authority over the merchant's address.

## Where the funds go

```
            buyer wallet (private key with buyer)
                       |
                       | Stellar payment operation, signed by buyer
                       v
            merchant address (private key with merchant)
                       |
                       | (no further movement initiated by SlipPay)
                       v
                merchant decides: hold, swap, off-ramp via MoneyGram, etc.
```

The merchant address is whatever the merchant entered in
`/v1/merchants/me` (`stellar_address`). SlipPay validates it's a
56-character Stellar pubkey but does not touch the corresponding secret
key — which never exists in any SlipPay system.

## What SlipPay observes (read-only)

SlipPay's listener polls Horizon's `/payments` endpoint filtered to the
merchant's address, paging forward with a persisted paging token and re-reading
on an interval. This is a **read-only** poll: there is no long-lived stream
subscription. The listener sees payments land but cannot modify the merchant's
account in any way. A per-account lease (`listener_leases`) lets only one
listener pod poll a given account, and the order-status write predicate stops a
pod that lost the lease from marking an order paid.

```
            Horizon /payments (polled)
                      |
                      v
          listener (apps/listener/src/horizon.ts)
                      |
                      v
              read-only event:
              { from, to, amount, asset, memo, hash }
                      |
                      v
              match to order via memo + amount + issuer
                      |
                      v
              update orders.status = paid (postgres)
                      |
                      v
              fire webhook to merchant
```

No write happens to Stellar from the listener. The DB write is internal
SlipPay state, not on-chain state.

## What SlipPay never does

These are excluded by design:

1. **Hold buyer fiat**. SlipPay does not accept BRL or any fiat directly
   in v0.1. (When the BR anchor partnership lands, the anchor — not
   SlipPay — holds the fiat for the millisecond it takes to mint USDC.)
2. **Hold merchant USDC**. Merchant address is the merchant's, period.
3. **Sign for the merchant**. Pause/resume on a Soroban subscription
   requires the merchant's signature; SlipPay backend cannot impersonate.
4. **Move funds without merchant authorization**. A pre-authorized
   subscription contract (v0.2) lets the buyer sign once for many future
   debits, but only the *buyer*'s authorization is delegated. Merchant
   authority is never delegated to SlipPay.

## What SlipPay does have

| asset | who controls it |
|---|---|
| Postgres database (merchants, orders, subs) | SlipPay |
| Stellar testnet platform keypair | SlipPay (used only for testing) |
| API keys (hash) | SlipPay (per-merchant) |
| Webhook secrets (hash) | SlipPay (per-merchant) |
| Buyer's USDC | buyer (via wallet) |
| Merchant's USDC | merchant (via Stellar address) |
| Merchant's secret key | merchant (offline / wallet) |

SlipPay controls the **routing infrastructure**. SlipPay does not control
**the funds**.

## Edge cases

### What if SlipPay disappears tomorrow

The merchant's address still exists on Stellar. Existing USDC balance is
unaffected. Future payments would have to be matched manually (the buyer
would need to know the memo to send), but the funds themselves are
unrelated to SlipPay's existence.

### What if SlipPay gets hacked

The attacker gets:

- Postgres data (orders, subscriptions, webhook URLs, hashed API keys).
- Hashed webhook secrets.
- The platform Stellar **testnet** keypair (mainnet platform keypair, when
  generated, is on a separate offline machine).

The attacker does **not** get:

- Merchant Stellar secret keys (never stored).
- Buyer Stellar secret keys (never stored).
- Plaintext API keys (only SHA-256 hashes are kept).

A hack is bad — orders could be tampered with, fake webhooks could be
sent to attacker-controlled URLs — but **funds are not directly
exfiltrable**. The attacker would need the merchant's wallet, which they
don't have.

### What if the merchant loses their secret key

The merchant loses access to the funds at that address. SlipPay cannot
recover them. This is the same property as any other non-custodial wallet:
**not your keys, not your coins**, applied to merchants.

To mitigate, merchants should use multi-sig (Stellar supports native
multi-sig at the account level) or a custodial wallet provider for the
receive address. Both are compatible with SlipPay; SlipPay only cares that
incoming payments to the address can be matched to orders.

## The "non-custodial where it matters" caveat

The platform fee leg (2.97% by default) is currently received at the same
address as the merchant payment, then off-cycle the platform sweeps its
share. In v0.2 this becomes a single atomic transaction with two
operations (merchant share + platform share), so the platform never
holds the merchant's portion at any instant. This is the "atomic
settlement" property that makes "non-custodial" a precise claim.

In v0.1, the platform briefly co-mingles its share with the merchant's
inbound flow. Merchants on a 100% non-custodial setup should configure
`platform_fee_bp` to 0 and accept SlipPay charges per-transaction via a
separate billing relationship.

## The signing moment: WYSIWYS

Non-custodial is only as strong as the signing moment. Holding no keys
means nothing if a compromised backend, a MITM, or a buggy API can
substitute the destination or inflate the amount in the XDR blob the user
signs without them noticing. SlipPay closes this gap with an explicit
**what-you-see-is-what-you-sign (WYSIWYS)** gate, enforced in code on
every money path.

The gate runs in this order on every payment:

1. **Build** — the app (or the Supabase edge function) constructs the
   unsigned transaction.
2. **Decode** — that exact transaction is decoded client-side;
   `apps/web/src/lib/txguard.ts` re-parses the XDR and re-derives its hash
   locally. It asserts the transaction is a single payment operation whose
   `{destination, amount, asset}` matches what the user expressed as
   intent. It rejects: NaN amounts, multi-operation smuggling (a second
   payment hidden inside the envelope), wrong asset, receiver substitution,
   amount drift. For Solana, the equivalent decode+assert runs in
   `apps/web/src/lib/solanaAuthorize.ts`.
3. **Assert** — the mismatch check is synchronous and fail-closed; if it
   throws, no confirmation dialog appears, signing is unreachable.
4. **Human confirm** — only after the user sees and confirms the decoded
   values does the gate proceed.
5. **Re-derive + sign** — the hash is re-derived from the decoded
   transaction locally (not trusted from the server), then signed.

`apps/web/src/lib/authorizeTx.ts` (Stellar) and
`apps/web/src/lib/solanaAuthorize.ts` (Solana) are the orchestrators the
UI must call for any signature. There is no bypass: signing is unreachable
without passing through these gates.

The gate is identical on all three surfaces — human checkout, agent rail,
comex treasury. A compromised server cannot make a user sign a payment they
did not see.

**Other enforced guarantees:**

- No server-side signing or authorization key is present in the web client
  bundle (CI-checkable: no `AUTHORIZATION_PRIVATE` or service-role secret
  in the built output).
- The relayer is a fee-payer only; it validates that sponsorable operations
  are limited to gas sponsorship and fails closed if anything else is
  attempted.
- Comex wallets are user-owned Privy embedded wallets, not server wallets.
  SlipPay never holds the private key.

## Comparison

| layer | SlipPay | Coinbase Commerce | BitPay |
|---|---|---|---|
| Buyer sends | direct to merchant addr (Stellar) | to Coinbase-controlled addr, swept later | to BitPay-controlled addr |
| Merchant settlement | on-chain, atomic | held by Coinbase, settled later | T+1 fiat or stablecoin |
| Custody during settlement | none (atomic) | Coinbase | BitPay |
| What happens if PSP dies | merchant address still has funds | merchant must reconcile with Coinbase | merchant must reconcile with BitPay |

Coinbase Commerce's self-managed mode is closest to SlipPay (also
non-custodial), but they're sunsetting that for international merchants
in 2025 in favor of custodial Coinbase Business. SlipPay's bet is that the
non-custodial property remains valuable for a tier of merchants who would
rather hold their own keys than route through a PSP.
